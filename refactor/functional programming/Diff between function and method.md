A method is always a function but not every function is a method. A function is defined as a piece of code that you can call.
Some programing languages like java don’t allow for normal functions. In java you can only create methods, this is not true for kotlin.
function is stateless, it’s not for behavior of a stateful object.

A method is a function that belongs to a specific class.
 Methods are functions defined in a specific class. An object has a state and behavior. Fields store it’s state, methods define its behavior.
 Generally speaking... a function is like a math function. You pass in certain thing(s), and you get something back out.
 Method, in programming, usually refers to code that's attached to a "class" that acts upon members of that class, i.e. Object-oriented programming. The usual example: say you have a class "Car", with properties like brand, model, color, trim, model year, engine type, speed, gear, steering wheel position, etc. It'd also have methods like start, accelerate, brake, turn, change gear, etc. that affects some of the properties. Some of the methods that belong to the class can be implemented as functions.
 There is no significant differance. The only difference is that one refers to a function as a method when dealing with classes/OOP.
 
 Quick preview: Class methods can be used to modify class variables to update and maintain state that is shared across all instances of that class. While instance methods and instance variables are specific to the values of a single object from that class.

(In case it isn't clear, class can be looked at as a blueprint while an instance can be looked at as an object built using that blueprint). Method is used for functions present inside a class. Functions are your general functions only.
Methods are part of the type, inside the class definition, whereas functions are external. Where we want a close coupling between an external function and a type we can define extension functions, which are called like methods but defined outside the class.

Conclusion:

in kotlin we have two concept 
Method and function
in java we just had Method  and in kotlin because of Functional programming that is another feature of kotlin beside oop we have new concept that we call function
when we have oop  we have class and we have specfic type of function that related to class we call member function 
in kotlin we able to define first class function call it function, function is pure 

oop or methos id impretive programming style
