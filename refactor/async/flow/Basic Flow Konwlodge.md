What is the flow ? asynchronous data stream while cold Flows are intended to be consumed by only one observer. Flow is a new Kotlin asynchronous stream library that is built on top of Kotlin coroutines. An asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception. A flow can emit multiple values instead of a single value and over a period of time. The `Flow` interface does not carry information whether a flow is a _cold_ stream that can be collected repeatedly and triggers execution of the same code every time it is collected. Kotlin Flow is ideal to use when you need to return multiple values asynchronously, such as automatic updates from your data source.
Flows are ideal for the parts of your application that involve live data updates. Or we can say Flow is a stream of Values that are computed asynchronously. Data Stream alaways return multiple value not single value.

**Why we can't use Sequence?**
For produce async value there is an reason Sequence like collections but the collection return multiple value at the same time. Sequence return when it produce like flow but sequence is synchronously data stream it means it blocks main thread until the produce values were finished. So it is not safe and we do not want to block the main thread.
