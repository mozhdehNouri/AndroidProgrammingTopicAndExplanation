We can't put all our code in a one file. So we need to spilit responsibilites and how we decide to spilit responsibilites into what file and what those file are responsible for doing that is specify our architecture patterns.
MVVM or MVI just slightly diffrent ways of arranging our code and each one sort of serves their own special purpose.
Architecture in software development is all about designing and organizing the code in a way that makes it easy to maintain and understand. when you have a lot of code, it's important to split it up into different files and components so that each part can be responsible for a specific task.
Organize the code, separate concerns, and make maintainable and scalable applications.
