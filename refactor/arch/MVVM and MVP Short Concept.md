**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: This pattern is similar to MVP but uses ViewModel, which is a  more abstract way of preparing data for the View. It reacts to changes in the model and presents the data for the UI (View), but it doesn’t directly handle user actions like in MVP or MVI.

 **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)**: Again, there’s a Model which is quite similar to MVVM and MVI’s Model in that it represents the data layer, but the Presenter is a middle-man that handles all the UI logic, working as a bridge between the View and the Model.
