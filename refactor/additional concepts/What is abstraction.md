Abstraction, in the context of programming and particularly in object-oriented programming (OOP), refers to the process of hiding complex implementation details and emphasizing only the essential features of an object or a system while ignoring unnecessary details.
Imagine you're building a software application to manage a zoo. In an abstracted model, you might have a Animal class with properties like name, species, and age, and methods like eat(), sleep(), and makeSound(). This abstraction allows you to work with animals in your program without needing to know the intricate details of each individual animal or the implementation of the methods. You're working at a higher level of conceptualization.

Abstraction is a core concept in all of computer science. Without abstraction, we would still be programming in machine code or worse not have computers in the first place.
Abstracting something means to give names to things, so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does.

Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

**Abstraction in the real world**
I’m a coffee addict. So, when I wake up in the morning, I go into my kitchen, switch on the coffee machine and make coffee. Sounds familiar?

Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of abstraction.

You need to know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee. You need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee you want to get.

The thing you don’t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew a fresh cup of delicious coffee. You don’t need to know the ideal temperature of the water or the amount of ground coffee you need to use.

Someone else worried about that and created a coffee machine that now acts as an abstraction and hides all these details. You just interact with a simple interface that doesn’t require any knowledge about the internal implementation.

**Different Types of Abstraction**
There are primarily two types of abstraction implemented in OOPs. One is data abstraction which pertains to abstracting data entities. The second one is process abstraction which hides the underlying implementation of a process. Let’s take a quick peek into both of these.
