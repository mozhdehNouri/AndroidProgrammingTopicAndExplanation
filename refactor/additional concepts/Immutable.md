**Immutability Makes Thread Safety Easier** You still need to carefully consider how your program uses immutable objects and shared state to avoid concurrency issues.
Immutability eliminates the risk of modifying the data itself by different threads, it doesn't automatically prevent all potential concurrent issues.

**What is Immutable?**
Immutable means that, once created, an object/variable canâ€™t be changed.
Any changes result in the creation of a new object with the updated state.

**What is thread-safe:**
Multiple threads can concurrently access and potentially modify shared
resources.
Thread safety ensures that these accesses and modifications occur correctly and consistently You can use **Mutex** For ensure Thread-safety in your application.
**Immutability Costs:** Creating new immutable objects on every
modification can incur performance overhead, especially for frequently updated data.

Immutability is a powerful concept that can significantly improve the
thread safety of your Android applications. By understanding its advantages, limitations, and best practices, you can make informed decisions and build robust, concurrent systems.
