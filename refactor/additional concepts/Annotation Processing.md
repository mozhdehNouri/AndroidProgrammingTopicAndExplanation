What is Annotation Processing and why we need to use them ?

Android developers can build complex apps with annotations scattered throughout, such as @Provides from Dagger or @ColorRes from AndroidX, without fully understanding how they work; they can almost feel like magic. This article will unshroud some of the magic by exploring the three main mechanisms that handle annotations: annotation processing, reflection, and lint. 


What are Kotlin annotations:

Annotations are a means of attaching metadata to code.

Annotation processing and reflection fall into the category of metaprogramming, a technique in which programs use other programs (eg. Kotlin source code) as their data. Both mechanisms leverage annotations to reduce boilerplate code and automate common tasks. For example, most dependency injection (eg. Dagger) and serialization (eg. Moshi) libraries use one or the other, or both. Annotation processing and reflection can achieve similar behavior — Moshi supports both mechanisms for generating JSON adapters. Lint is a different use case, using annotations to check source files for issues. Whether it counts as metaprogramming is hazy.


What is meta programming :
Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.[1][2] In some cases, this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution, in turn reducing development time.[3] It also allows programs a greater flexibility to efficiently handle new situations without recompilation.

Metaprogramming can be used to move computations from run-time to compile-time, to generate code using compile time computations, and to enable self-modifying code. The ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage is called reflection.[4] Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.


Annotation Proccesing:
Annotation processors are compiler plugins that generate code based on annotations at compile time. You know a third-party library includes an annotation processor when it requires using annotationProcessor, kapt or ksp instead of implementation as its build.gradle dependency configuration. Popular libraries that rely on annotation processing include Dagger (@Provides, @Inject), Moshi (@Json), and Room (@Entity, @Dao).




 **KAPT:**
 KAPT is a Java-based Annotation Processor, which is tied to the JVM, while KSP is a code processor which depends only on Kotlin and can be more natural to Kotlin developers.
 On another note, KAPT needs to have access to Java generated stubs to modify the program input based on annotations. This stage happens after all the symbols in the program (such as types) are completely resolved. This stage takes 30% of the compiler time and can be costly.

KSP:
KSP is a Kotlin-first alternative to kapt introduced in 2021. With direct integration into the Kotlin compiler (kotlinc), KSP analyzes Kotlin code directly without generating Java stubs and is up to 2x faster than kapt. It also has a better understanding of Kotlin’s language constructs.

Reflection:
Reflection is defined as a language’s ability to inspect its classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime without knowing their names at compile time. It lets programs dynamically instantiate new objects and invoke methods — ie. modify their structure and behavior at runtime. Popular libraries that use reflection to modify program behavior include Moshi (@Json) and Retrofit (@GET, @POST).

Annotation Processing and Its Importance
Annotation Processing is a powerful technique used in Android and Kotlin development to handle annotations at compile time. Annotations, like @Provides from Dagger or @ColorRes from AndroidX, are metadata attached to code that can guide how the code is processed and executed. Annotation processing allows us to automate repetitive tasks, generate boilerplate code, and ensure code correctness, enhancing development efficiency and reducing the likelihood of errors.

Metaprogramming and Annotations
Metaprogramming is a technique where programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. This means a program can read, generate, analyze, or transform other programs and even modify itself during execution. Annotations are a key part of metaprogramming in Kotlin, used extensively to reduce boilerplate code and automate tasks like dependency injection (Dagger) and serialization (Moshi).

Annotation Processing in Kotlin: KAPT and KSP
KAPT (Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool)
KAPT is a Java-based annotation processor adapted for Kotlin. It allows Kotlin code to use Java annotation processors. Here are its key features:

Java Integration: KAPT works well with Java-based annotation processors, making it compatible with many existing libraries.
Java Stubs: To process annotations, KAPT generates Java stubs, which are simplified representations of Kotlin code in Java. This step ensures that Java-based processors can understand and manipulate Kotlin code.
Performance Overhead: Generating Java stubs can be costly, consuming up to 30% of the compiler time, which can slow down the build process.
KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)
KSP is a newer, Kotlin-first alternative to KAPT. Introduced in 2021, it is designed to be more efficient and better integrated with the Kotlin compiler:

Direct Kotlin Integration: KSP directly interacts with Kotlin code, eliminating the need for Java stubs and reducing processing time.
Performance: KSP is up to 2x faster than KAPT because it avoids the overhead associated with generating and processing Java stubs.
Kotlin Understanding: KSP has a better grasp of Kotlin-specific language features, providing more natural and efficient processing for Kotlin code.
Reflection
Reflection is another metaprogramming technique that allows a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. It enables dynamic creation of objects and invocation of methods without knowing their names at compile time. Libraries like Moshi and Retrofit use reflection to work with annotations such as @Json and @GET, enabling flexible and dynamic behavior.

Runtime Flexibility: Reflection provides the flexibility to handle new scenarios dynamically at runtime.
Performance Considerations: While powerful, reflection can be slower and more resource-intensive compared to compile-time annotation processing.

Annotation processing and reflection are essential tools in Android and Kotlin development for automating tasks, reducing boilerplate, and enhancing code flexibility. KAPT and KSP are two approaches to annotation processing, with KSP offering a more Kotlin-centric and performant solution. Understanding and leveraging these tools can significantly improve development productivity and code quality.
