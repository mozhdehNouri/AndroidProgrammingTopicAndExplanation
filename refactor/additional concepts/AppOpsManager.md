App-ops are employed for two distinct purposes: access control and tracking. 


The AppOpsManager class provides a way for developers to manage app operations. It lets them run checks and manage permissions for different operations that apps can perform also It lets them monitor and change which apps can access specific features of the device. 

AppOpsManager enables developers to check whether an app has permission to perform certain operations that might affect the device or other apps. This is particularly useful for operations that go beyond standard Android permissions.

For example, they can use AppOpsManager to prevent an app from accessing the camera. or you can use AppOpsManager to keep an eye on and control things like location access, file access, or accessing contacts.

- AppOpsManager can be used to create apps with enhanced security features by ensuring that only allowed operations are performed, based on user or system preferences.

- AppOpsManager has methods for starting and stopping operations, which can be useful for logging and monitoring how your app is being used. 

- also AppOpsManager can be useful to handle cases where certain operations are restricted by the system or user settings.
