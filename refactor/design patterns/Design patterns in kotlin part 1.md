A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.


Advantage of design patterns:

Reusability
Design patterns promote the reuse of proven solutions to common problems. By applying design patterns, we can use established templates to solve recurring design issues, saving time and effort in development.

Maintainability
Design patterns enhance code maintainability by providing a clear and organized structure. When developers are familiar with common design patterns, it becomes easier for them to understand and modify the code, reducing the chances of introducing bugs during maintenance.

Abstraction and Encapsulation
Design patterns often involve abstraction and encapsulation, which help in hiding the complexity of the implementation details. This separation allows developers to focus on high-level design decisions without getting bogged down by low-level details.

Flexibility
Design patterns make code more flexible and adaptable to change. When the structure of our software is based on well-established patterns, it becomes easier to introduce new functionality or modify existing behavior without affecting the entire system.

Code Understandability
Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers. When a developer sees a particular pattern being used, they can quickly understand the intent and functionality without delving deeply into the implementation details.
