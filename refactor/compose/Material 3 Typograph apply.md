**Display:**
There are three display styles in the default type scale: Large, medium, and small. As the largest text on the screen, display styles are reserved for short, important text or numerals. They work best on large screens.![[Screenshot (335).png]]

Headline
Headlines are best-suited for short, high-emphasis text on smaller screens. These styles can be good for marking primary passages of text or important regions of content.![[Pasted image 20240511155927.png]]![[Pasted image 20240511155935.png]]

Title
Titles are smaller than headline styles, and should be used for medium-emphasis text that remains relatively short. For example, consider using title styles to divide secondary passages of text or secondary regions of content.
