**Display:**
There are three display styles in the default type scale: Large, medium, and small. As the largest text on the screen, display styles are reserved for short, important text or numerals. They work best on large screens.![[Screenshot (335).png]]

Headline
Headlines are best-suited for short, high-emphasis text on smaller screens. These styles can be good for marking primary passages of text or important regions of content.![[Pasted image 20240511155927.png]]![[Pasted image 20240511155935.png]]

Title
Titles are smaller than headline styles, and should be used for medium-emphasis text that remains relatively short. For example, consider using title styles to divide secondary passages of text or secondary regions of content.

Label
Label styles are smaller, utilitarian styles, used for things like the text inside components or for very small text in the content body, such as captions.
